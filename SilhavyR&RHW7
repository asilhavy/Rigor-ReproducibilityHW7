First and perhaps foremost these sources offer an easy way by which those looking to utilize your data or otherwise view your work can do so in a stable fashion. These repositories are well maintained as well as upheld, allowing them to be accessed over time, thereby strengthening the rigor as well as reproducibility of ones' work. Furthermore they also offers a means of security, offering a secondary site by which data and other resources may be preserved. A form of or similar method of this may even be vital depending on grant requirements. Continuing, such resources also offer an electronic trail, allowing for the chronology to be understood in a work's life and ownership should the need arise. Paired with the ability to also allow worldwide collaboration through the power of the internet the overall advantages of using such tools are evident and I look forward to using them as I continue with my work! I hope you find this summary helpful and I wish you a very fine Halloween!\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"xUnmjQKd3PWL"}}]}
